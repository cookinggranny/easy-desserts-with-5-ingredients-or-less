<p><b><h1>5 Reasons Why You Suck at Siege</h1></b></p>
<br></br>
<p><h2>Number 1: Not Hitting Your Headshots</h2></p>
<p>As many other skills as there are in Siege, at it's core, it is still a FPS (First Person Shooter). Whether you're initiating the gunfights or reacting to them, you must aim for the head. Headshots are a one-shot kill in Siege, which can be the difference beteween you winning that gunfight or getting headshot in return.</p>
<p><h2>Number 2: Crosshair Placement</h2></p>
<p>This is pretty self explanatory. A lot of times in lower ranks, you'll see players aiming in the general direction of where they think the opponent is going to come from. Instead, you should aim at "head level" and at the exact position of where you believe the opponent <i>will</i> come from. This will give you the initial advantage in the gunfight as all you need to do now is react to the player entering your crosshair, instead of having to readjust your aim onto them.
<br>Below is an example of what not to do <b>vs</b> what to do.</br></p>

<br>Notice how in the first image, my body is more exposed than it needs to be and I'm aiming at the middle of the doorway, foot-level. This is corrected in the second image as I tighten up my angle and aim at head-level.</br>
<br></br>
<p><h2>Number 3: Not Positioning For Refrags and Trades</h2></p>
<p>A bit more of a higher-level concept, this can be tricky to understand and get right without some help. The idea behind "refragging" is when one of your teammates dies, you kill the person that killed your teammate. Trading is a similar concept, except it doesn't necessarily have to be the same person that killed your teammate. It could be anyone on the other team; this will even out the mancount from your teammate initially dying, hence "trading." Now, to enable this entire idealogy, you must <a href="EasterEgg.html" target="blank">position</a> for it. This is playing with your teammates and communicating who's peeking the angle first, who's watching flank, etc. You must play together for this to work, ideally in a 2 and 3-man fashion - no running off on a solo mission. This is imperative in Siege as Siege is a game where generally a man-advantage, if played right, will guarantee a round win.</p>
<br></br>
<p><h2>Number 4: Lack of Game Sense</h2></p>
<p>Game sense is a multitude of factors: predicting the enemy's movements and plans, knowing the common spots people sit, knowing how to play your operator effectively and countering the opponent's operators. There's much more than that and most of it is "knowing how to" and understanding the fundamentals of the game. It's more intuitive and comes easier for some, while for others it just feels like they'll never understand the game and they'll keep losing. To those that are naturally able to pick up a game and be "good" at it, it's a foreign feeling to "not know how" or understand people that don't know how. Regardless, this ability is essentially to getting better at Siege because having gun-skill will only take you so far. This point ties into the next point which is:</p>
<br></br>
<p><h2>Number 5: You Just Need To Practice/Play More</h2></p>
<p>At the end of the day, you suck at Siege because you're not playing it enough and <i>trying</i> to get better. Keyword: trying. You can play the game all day and have fun, but you're only going to improve at a miniscule rate, if any. In order to get better, you have to think about what you're doing and why it's working or not working and reflect upon that. This alone will help improve the aforementioned game sense just because you're playing the game more. More time in game means more time invested into recognizing common patterns and utilizing those effectively in future matches.</p>
